# arithLang
A simple language as was implemented in [this](http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/360/) class. The class walks you through developping a parser for the language, 
an interpretor, a dynamic type system as well as a static type system. It shows how to add variables, closures as well as functions
into the language. Along, the way, functional programming concepts such as the simply typed lambda calculus, algebraic
data types, polymorphic types and monads are introduced.
